## Summary

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the assignment for Laboratory 5 assignment in Computer Science 403.

This laboratory assignment invites you to work individually tho solve challenges related to web and network security on TryHackMe. You are also responsible for writing a detailed reflection, stored in the file `reflection.md`. This is a Markdown file that must adhere to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Objectives

To apply the conceptual knowledge learned so far to solving challenges. To learn how to use tools that can be used to solve capture the flag (CTF) type of challenges. To develop a deeper appreciation of the types of problem solving that is often involved in computer security.

## Code of Conduct

Throughout the completion of this project you must adhere to the [community guidelines](https://github.com/CMPSC403-AlleghenyCollege-Fall2021/community_guidelines) that we developed as a class. In addition to reporting any violations of the code of conduct, please make sure that you have followed the code of conduct during this lab. Students who think that the class should revise some aspect of the guidelines must use the GitHub issue tracker for that repository to suggest, discuss, and implement any required changes.

## Assignment Specification

In this lab you will complete two walkthrough rooms and several CTF challenges. Specifically you are invited to complete at least two CTF rooms. You are then invited to reflect on your experiences in a Markdown file given in this repository.

1. Lab 5.1:
2. Lab 5.2: 
3. Lab 5.3:
- 

## Required Deliverables

This assignment invites you to submit the following deliverables.

1. Lab 5.1 on TryHackMe.
2. Lab 5.2 on TryHackMe.
3. Lab 5.3 on TryHackMe.
4. Reflection document submitted via your lab05 repository.

## Assignment Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up to 20%]:**: Students will receive a part of their grade when the responses to the writing questions presented in the `reflection.md` reveal a proficiency of both writing skills and technical knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate answers.

- **Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills [up to 80%]**: Students will receive a full portion of this part of their assignment grade when their completed assignments on TryHackMe for this lab reveal that they have mastered all of the technical knowledge and skills developed during the completion of this lab. As a part of this grade, the instructor will assess aspects of the lab including, but not limited to, the number of questions completed and the points received on TryHackMe platform.

All grades for this project will be reported through a student's gradebook GitHub repository and the solution will be posted after the grade release in the [starter lab 05 repository](https://github.com/CMPSC403-AlleghenyCollege-Fall2021/lab05).
